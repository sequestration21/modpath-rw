# Solute transport near a low-permeability zone
This problem is presented in the MT3DMS documentation (Zheng & Wang, 1999), discussing different numerical schemes for advection. Problem illustrates solute injection near a low-permeability zone.

Flow model is steady (with MODFLOW-6) and MODPATH-RW model injects particles with the ``SRC`` package, using auxiliary variables given to the flow model. 

MODPATH-RW name file includes the following packages:

```
MPBAS      p09sim.mpbas
GRBDIS     gwf-p09-mf6.dis.grb
TDIS       gwf-p09-mf6.tdis
HEAD       gwf-p09-mf6.hds
BUDGET     gwf-p09-mf6.bud
DSP        p09sim.dsp
RWOPTS     p09sim.rwopts
OBS        p09sim.obs
SRC        p09sim.src
```

In order to run the program, it is first necessary to execute the MODFLOW-6 simulation. MODPATH-RW simulation file is configured to run a MODPATH-RW timeseries and can be executed with the command

```
mpathrw p09sim.mprw
```

Explore the program command line interface options for help and instructions to run in parallel (``mpathrw -h``).
